"An unusual tale of how one person repopulates Minecraftia...."

Minecraftia has been destroyed and you are the only survivor. You actually have no recollection of the disaster or how you were saved. With the help of the goddess, perhaps you can repopulate the world and make it better than ever.


This is a different take on how to do a wasteland pack. The main focus is on Harvest Festival with other mods added for convenience and more content. Farm, raise livestock, cook, and earn money by selling your wares. With the money you earn buy new buildings and bring back the people of Minecraftia. As your town grows and life becomes a little easier, explore the secrets Minecraftia has to offer.
